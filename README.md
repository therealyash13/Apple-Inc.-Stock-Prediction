# Apple-Inc.- Stock-Prediction
When we talk about Apple two things come to mind, one is Steve Jobs and other a revolutionary product that he released on Sept 2007. In terms of finance perspective Apple is the most valuable company right now and it is also in a race to become the first 1 trillion-dollar company. That’s something that takes time to digest but corporation reaching 1 trillion mark was unimaginable. The main cash cow for Apple is the iPhone. It roughly generates 60% of total revenues for Apple. 
This company is very fortunate that it was able to release products that changed some industries. It changed the personal computer industry with its computers, then it changed the Music Industry by making a portable music playing device taglined” Thousand Songs in Your Pocket” the iPod and then came the iPhone and it changed everything not just the smartphone industry but also how people lived in the 20th century. iPhone has been named best consumer product numerous times. 
The reason for Apple’s success is because it offers you quality hardware with easy-to-use software and the lifetime of its products is very good when compared to competitors. You must know consumers who still use an 4yr old iPhone. The customer satisfaction also plays a big role in its success. We might already look like an Apple Public relation person, but the above stated words are what made the company with most loyalty.
In short we think Apple’s motive to make best products and not products that sell well sets them apart from other manufacturers. It’s a very different and mature approach towards making products. The Apple ecosystem is a competitive advantage as they make it difficult for you to change to another ecosystem. They have a very efficient and productive sync between all their devices. The Brand Value of Apple is off charts and they have earned it in such a less time. Apple’s stock prices have a significant growth over the years. So we decided to scrap Apple’s stock data from yahoo finance directly from web using some python packages and built machine learning models and time series models to predict and forecast the stock prices of Apple and solve a business evaluation for people who thinks to invest in Apple Inc.


## Machine Learning Models
After importing the data, engineering the features and pre-processing the dataset, now it time for modelling and predicting the closing amount of the stocks. Then the data is split into training and testing data. Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Boosting (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) models along with Time series models like, LSTM, SARIMA and Facebook’s Prophet models were also built and the performance of the models are calculated and the parameters are tuned for improving the model performance.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, Data mining in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have achieved a vital turning point, augmenting and extending practically any technology-enabled service, product, or application. Artificial intelligence entails a boost in our knowledge to fix issues and come up with new ideas. Unsupervised learning algorithms that we have used are analogous to human intelligence in that the model learns gradually before calculating the output, and it is highly useful for detecting patterns in the data that are tough to locate using traditional approaches.  Because data mining is a component of big data analytics, we participated in this module as a data miner to evaluate and understand the supplied data. Data mining is used to uncover previously unseen patterns and correlations in a dataset. To summarize, in this project we created various tree based and time series-based machine learning models to work on a dataset by cleaning, analysing, engineering the features, visualizing and building models using different machine learning models, predicting the outcome, and tuning its parameters for better performance and regularizing the parameters.

As a result, we looked into future Apple stock closing price predictions to see if we should invest in the stock. We arrived at the conclusion that investors can invest in Apple's stock market because of the high closing price.
